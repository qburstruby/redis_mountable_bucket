= RedisMountableBucket

 RedisMountableBucket is a gem that acts as an api engine which mounts automattically into the rails application on installation.
 This gem is used to access basic redis methods such as storing data as key-value pairs, fetching the specified key's value, deleting the specified key's value or getting all the keys from the redis.

== Installation

=== The master branch supports versions >= Rails 3

Add the gem to the gemfile:
  	gem "redis_mountable_bucket"
  	
Mount the redis_bucket engine onto your rails app:
  	rails g mount_redis_engine engine

== Usage

rake routes in your rails application specifies these routes:

	Routes for RedisBucket::Engine:
	    store_redis_data POST   	/redis_data/store(.:format)    redis_bucket/redis_data#store
	    fetch_redis_data POST   	/redis_data/fetch(.:format)    redis_bucket/redis_data#fetch
	    remove_redis_data POST   	/redis_data/remove(.:format)   redis_bucket/redis_data#remove
		getallkeys_redis_data POST  /redis_data/get_keys(.:format) redis_bucket/redis_data#get_keys	
	
	e.g.
	localhost:3000/redis_bucket/redis_data/get_keys
	returns the json value with all the redis key details.

	The json format of the result for above api calls is:
		{ :response => "success",
		  :status => 200,
	  	  :info => "Successfully retrieved all keys",                      
	   	  :data => 'data from the redis'}
